Hello there

if you're wondering why i'm not using *M*VC
you've come to the right place.

this website should be created in 1 day and a half from the time i'm writing this message (04-02-2019 11:00PM)
coding models and using that structure for the website will take a bit longer than just calling a controller and getting a response back

if you're wondering why code is so messy it is the same reason why i didn't use models

why smarty? i used it a lot in the past and i'm familiar with how good it is


Regards,
B1Q
